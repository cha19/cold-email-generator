      "The first person to land on the moon was Neil Armstrong. He stepped out of the lunar module Eagle and onto the moon's surface on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission.

      "* At 20:17 UTC, the Eagle landed on the moon's surface in the Sea of Tranquility.\n",
      "* At 02:56 UTC on July 21, 1969, Armstrong radioed back to Mission Control on Earth, \"Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.\"\n",
      "* Six hours later, at 10:56 UTC, Armstrong made history by stepping out of the lunar module and onto the moon's surface.\n",
      "* Armstrong and Aldrin spent about two and a half hours on the moon's surface, collecting samples and conducting experiments.\n",
      "* They returned to the Eagle and lifted off from the moon at 23:54 UTC on July 21, 1969.\n",
      "* The Apollo 11 astronauts successfully splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on July 24, 1969, marking the end of their historic mission.\n",
